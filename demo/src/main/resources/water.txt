In other words, there’s very little reason to believe that children who have a spot urine measurement of 800 mOsm/kg
should be worried. In fact, back in 2002, a study was published in the Journal of Pediatrics, one that was more
exploratory in nature than a look for dehydration, and it found that boys in Germany had an average urine osmolality
of 844 mOsm/kg. The third-to-last paragraph in the paper recounted a huge number of studies from all over the world
finding average urine mOsm/kg in children ranging from 392 mOsm/kg in Kenya to 964 in Sweden.

That hasn’t stopped more recent studies from continuing to use the 800 mOsm/kg standard to declare huge numbers of
children to be dehydrated. A 2012 study in the Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism used it to declare that almost
two-thirds of French children weren’t getting enough water. Another in the journal Public Health Nutrition used it to
declare that almost two-thirds of children in Los Angeles and New York City weren’t getting enough water. The first
study was funded by Nestlé Waters; the second by Nestec, a Nestlé subsidiary.
